# SwiftPlus

SwiftPlus is a package that includes various Swift and SwiftUI extensions and Views that I found myself using across multiple projects. It includes extensions for Date String formatting, various View extensions for making working with SwiftUI even easier, and more. Some of the code in SwiftPlus was taken from various posts across Stack Overflow. When this is the case, the URL to whatever post the code came from is included in the applicable code's documentation.

## Platform Support

SwiftPlus only supports iOS 16 and above.

## Installation

To use SwiftPlus in your projects, add it using Swift Package Manager. To do this, open Xcode and select File > Add Packages...
